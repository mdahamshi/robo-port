Sunrise


Shurooq is the time of sunrise, the time when the upper limb of the sun just
starts to appear above the horizon. This marks the end time for Fajr (morning)
prayer.

×

Qiyam


The term Qiyam-ul-layl, in the most literal sense, means to stand during the
night. It is a voluntary prayer which is offered between the time of Ishaa
prayer and the Fajr prayer (before dawn). But the most preferred time is before
sunrise, in the last third of the night.For more information, read our article
on qiyam.

The difference between Standard and Hanafi (Juristic Methods)


The only difference is in the Asr prayer. In the standard method (which is used
by Imamas Shafii, Hanbali, and Maliki) the Asr prayer time starts when the
shadow of an object is equivalent to its height, whereas in the Hanafi method
the Asr prayer time starts when the shadow of an object is twice its height.

×

Daylight Saving Time


Daylight Saving Time (DST) is the practice of setting the clocks forward one
hour from standard time during the summer months, and back again in the fall,
in order to make better use of natural strong daylight. IslamicFinder Website
is adjusting daylight savings automatically according to your location.

×

Latitude and Longitude


To calculate the prayer times for a given location, we need to know the
latitude and the longitude of your current city or town, along with the local
timezone for that location. IslamicFinder is detecting longitude, latitude and
timezone of your current city or town automatically. If you face any difference
in prayer timings according to your current location then please confirm these
latitude and longitude first. You can also use our '  Choose Coordinates  '
option to change latitude, longitude and timezone of your current location. You
can find this option of 'Choose Coordinates  ' from Top Search bar by simply
click on it.
